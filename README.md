# White-Box Evolver: The Pure Logic Neural Architecture
**(Hyper-Tensor Protocol for Transparent, Differentiable AI)**

> "From Black-Box Probabilities to White-Box Algebraic Derivation."

We have dismantled the cryptographic locks to unleash the ultimate logical engine. We trade privacy for **infinite trainability** and **perfect interpretability**.

## 📖 Core Vision
**White-Box Evolver** aims to reconstruct the underlying logic of artificial intelligence. We have stripped away the cryptographic hardness (DLP) of the original protocol, replacing chaotic Class Groups with **Smooth Differentiable Manifolds**.

In this architecture, every inference is not a guess, but a **rigorous, traceable algebraic derivation** that supports both Gradient Descent and direct Algebraic Inversion.

## 📐 The Paradigm Shift: From Chaos to Order

We have replaced the "discrete and chaotic" math with "continuous and smooth" math, while preserving the core **Non-Commutative Causality**.

### 1. Differentiable Evolution
Evolution is no longer a one-way cryptographic hash, but a reversible linear transformation:

$$S_{t} = \mathcal{F}(S_{t-1}, W_{logic}) + \vec{b}_{bias}$$

* **$S_{t}$ (State):** The transparent logical state vector (Continuous).
* **$W_{logic}$ (Logic Matrix):** The learnable weight matrix, replacing the old Prime Weights.
* **$\vec{b}_{bias}$ (Control Vector):** The precision guidance term (based on Theorem 5.7).

### 2. The Training Revolution
* **Gradient Descent (GD):** Since the manifold is smooth, we can calculate $\nabla Loss$. Training is now **differentiable**.
* **Algebraic Inversion:** If the model makes an error ($S_{out} \neq Target$), we can analytically **solve** for the correct weight $W$ using inverse operations ($W = S_{in}^{-1} \cdot Target$). This allows for "One-Shot Learning."

## 🏗️ Architecture: The Glass Engine

Based on the refactored source code (`src/core/algebra.rs`, `src/train_loop.rs`), the system now operates as a **White-Box Logic Machine**:

### 1. Transparent Neurons
* **No More Primes:** `HTPNeuron` now processes high-precision floating-point tensors or Lie Group elements.
* **Causality Preserved:** We strictly maintain the **Non-Commutative Time Operator** ($\oplus_{time}$), ensuring that the order of logic ($A \to B \neq B \to A$) is mathematically rigid.

### 2. Inverse Decoder (The Solver)
* **Exact Navigation:** Instead of searching a chaotic lattice, the `InverseDecoder` now uses linear projection to map algebraic states directly to Token coordinates.
* **Zero Hallucination:** A mathematical error in derivation leads to a "Type Error" or "Coordinate Mismatch" rather than a plausible-sounding lie.

### 3. Hyper-Fast Training
* **Discarded:** Evolutionary Strategies (Mutation/Crossover) are removed.
* **Adopting:** Standard Backpropagation + Algebraic Direct Solution.
